![home](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45206652/91416594-e4636100-e84f-11ea-905c-86d78507ef97.PNG)

## About
Youâ€™re [here](https://fsl-pandorabox.herokuapp.com/) because we share the same passion for the greatest invention of mankind. If 70s, 80s, 90s and early 00s football/soccer is totally your vibe, you have come to the right place!

#### Functionality
The application consists of 4 main sections providing the user with the possibility of:
1. Homepage: Find the most popular recipes which are displayed in the homepage
2. Find Recipe: Fitler throught a variety of recipes from France, italy, Brawil among others
3. Create Recipe: Share his cooking skills by posting a recipe on Oui Chef!
4. Sign Up & Login: Like, dislike and post his opinions on the recipes of Oui Chef!

#### Goal

The application is designed to users who often or ocasssionaly look for a recipe based on his needs and preferences such as recipe origin, skill level, preparation time and serving size.

## UX

#### Layout
 
- The Multiple Page Apps (MPA) design was due to the complexity and CRUD charactheristic of the app where user can manipulate data by creating, reading, updating, and deleting interactions. Therefore, having an user-friendly design was needed in order to make it easy for users to create, like, dislike, delete and update new or existing recipes..
- The database selected was MongoDB Atals, where all CRUD operations are handled in an effective and fast way. 
- The app is designed for users to interact with each other by sharing their cooking experiences and opinions.

#### Important Note

- It is important to emphasize that the application heavily relies on the user when it comes to the expansion of its database. Its main goal is to create a common and friendly place where people can share their recipes and learn about different cuisines.

#### Colour Scheme

- Taking into account the main theme of the app, the idea is to have the looks of a modern kitchen by applying grey and white resembling a fridge, stove, oven, kitchen cabinets and table.
- [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/) provided me with complementary, compound, analogous, and monochromatic shades of grey and white.
- Color
    - ![#404040](https://placehold.it/15/404040/000000?text=+) `#404040` colour description: Grey.
    - ![#fffff9](https://placehold.it/15/fffff9/000000?text=+) `#fffff9` colour description: White. 
    - ![#ffab40](https://placehold.it/15/ffab40/000000?text=+) `#ffab40` colour description: Orange. 

#### Font

## Features

#### Existing Features

As the applications consists of a MPA, I applied an easy navigation where the user can clearly see where to create, edit, search, or look for a recipe:

- Find Recipe: In the Find Recipe section, users can select and filter the recipes by country of origin, difficulty, preparation time. and serving size. In case he/she is not satisfied with the filtering chosen, they can reset the selected criteria in order to fit thie needs. 
- Create Recipe: In the Create Recipe section the user has the possibility to create and update existing recipes.
- Like & Dislike: When accessing a recipe page, users can like or dislike the recipe. Users must be logged in to like/dislike a recipe.
- Comment Section: Once logged in, users can leave a comment on a recipe's page.

#### Features Left to Implement

- I wish to implement a profile page for each user. In this way, users can share their cooking preferences in a detailed manner.
- A feature which I wil soon implement is the possibility for users to upload videos when cooking a recipe.
- The possibility to sign up using a facebook or gmail is also a feature which will be implement in the application.

## Syntax Testing

Resources & Tools Used for Testing

#### HTML
-[W3 HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

#### CSS
-[W3 CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

#### Responsiveness

- Responsive design has been applied to all kinds of devices including small, medium, and large phones as well as tablets, laptop, and desktop views. 

#### Testing Criteria

- a) In this session, testing user interface was done by running multiple combinations when searching for a recipe using all four filtering types aiming to have the expected outcome. One example of criteria set is shown below:
    1. Country of Origin: Brazilian
    2. Difficulty: Medium
    3. Cooking Time: Very Long (More than 4hrs)
    4. Servings: More than 6 people

- b) Here the idea was to test the Sign In and Sign Up funtions:
    1. Username: Testing
    2. Password: Test123

- c) In this session, the goal was to test the like, dislike and comment features for a recipe with no likes, dislikes or posted comments.

- d) The fourth test was designed to test the all CRUD possibilities for a new/existing recipe.

- d) The final test aimed to test all external links in the application.

#### Testing Outcome

- a) As expected the result came out as the recipe "Feijoada" matching all searching criteria highlighted above.

- b) User 'Testing' was successfully registered and able to login and logout afterwards.

- c) The like, dislike and comment features were successfully deployed as we can see in the image below:

- d) All CRUD operations passed the test when creating, reading, updating and deleting the recipe 'Best-Ever Grilled Cheese':

- e) All external links in the footer section worked as expected.


#### Issues During Testing Sessions

- The features like and dislike can be done multiple times by the same user. Therefore, this feature will be reworked which will unable such scenario.
- The view count presents a similar behavior as for the two features mentioned above. The goal for such feature is to register a single view count for each user.

## Deployment

This website is hosted on Heroku, and it is deployed automatically from its mater branch on GitHub. Therefore, once a new commit has been done the changes will automatically take effect on the live application. 

Additionally, if you wish to run the code locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting `git clone https://github.com/Litran1990/DataCentricMilestoneProject` into your terminal. In order to cut ties with this GitHub repository, type `git remote rm origin` into the terminal.
